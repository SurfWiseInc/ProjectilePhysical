Simulation of Ballistic Shot

The project extends the built-in physics engine with custom integration methods. The simulations takes regard of physical forces acting on a projectile - aerodynamic drag and force due to wind.

Project implements Signleton and Object Pooling design patterns.

Concept is based on https://www.habrador.com/tutorials/unity-realistic-bullets/ but modified and expanded.
