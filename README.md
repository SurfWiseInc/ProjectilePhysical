 Simulation of Ballistic Shot using custom integration methods

 Being aware of limitations upon Unity3d built-in physics engine I've simulated projectile using custom integration methods and combined results it with Unity3d    Engine. The simulation takes regard of physical forces acting on a projectile such as aerodynamic drag and force due to wind.

 In project I've used Signleton and Object Pooling design patterns.

 Concept is based on https://www.habrador.com/tutorials/unity-realistic-bullets/) but but modified and expanded.
 
 Big thanks to this guy and his professional tutorials on physics in Unity.
